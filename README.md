   This was essential for analyzing trends across various restaurant attributes.
3. Conditional Formatting: Highlighted critical data points like high-rated restaurants, restaurants with the best price-to-value ratio, 
   and those offering both table booking and online delivery.
4. Data Visualization: Created charts (bar, pie, and line charts) to visually represent key trends, such as the distribution of cuisines,
   average cost for two across different cities, and customer ratings distribution.
5. Data Cleaning: Used techniques like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.
